# CS50
<h3>What is this</h3>

<p>This repo is dedicated to the files developed for the online cs course presented by David J. Malan
from the University of Harvard <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50:
An introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.<a>
It is meant to cover the standard topics that are taught in a typical undergraduate computer science course
and it offers various tracks such as IOS, Android or Web development depending on the student interests.<p>

<p>The folders here have both solutions for the proposed problem sets but also have some lecture notes and extra material on Data Structure
and Memory that I felt like adding for exercising what I learned. The repo was build out of my directories from the
<a href="https://cs50.readthedocs.io/ide/online/"> cloud-based Integrated Development Environment<a> CS50 offers but naturally the files can be
open and edited in any other IDE. For more information about the course visit the official <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/">website<a>.<p>
